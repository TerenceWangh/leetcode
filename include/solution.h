     * 13. Roman to Integer

     * I             1
     * V             5

     * D             500
     * M             1000
     * 
     * For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together.
     * Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is
     *  written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
     * 
     * Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However,
     * the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because
     * the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to
     * the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is
     * used:

     * > X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
     * > C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
